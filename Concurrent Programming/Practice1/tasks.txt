Simple Java class

Create a Java class called Employee. An Employee has two private fields, called name and salary. 
Create a public constructor that initializes these fields. 
Also create public getters for these fields and a method that raises the salary 
by a given percent (a floating point value passed as parameter).

In this exercise and all the other ones, 
create a class whose main method tests the described functionality. 
Make sure that you can compile the code and run it.
